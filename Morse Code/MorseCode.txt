You are a great and excellent investigator, you like creating and solving
mysteries, puzzles. You got curious about morse code and got hooked to it.
Morse code had been dominantly used in World War II. Below are tables with details of
the morse code but with a difference. Instead of using the symbols “.” , “-“ they are
represented as “di”,”dah” also if dot is at the end it is written as “dit”.

Write a function called decodeMorse() which takes in a string of symbols “.” , “-“ does
two levels of decode first gives it in for “di”,”dah” , “dit” and then the English alphabet or
digits or punctuation mark. Your function should print both the levels of decoding.
Validate the input , the function should not take only “.” , “-“ Note that after each
character there is a single space and between words two spaces.
